# Circumventing the Defense against Modulation Classification Attacks

Modulation classification (MC) has a wide range of applications in spectrum sharing, 
management, and enforcement and can also be used by an adversary to launch traffic 
analysis or selective jamming. While recent modulation obfuscation techniques show 
promising results in mitigating MC attacks, in this paper we develop a novel convolution 
neural network (CNN)-based model to attack those defenses and successfully identify the 
true modulation scheme. Our extensive simulation and over-the-air experiments using show 
that our classification technique achieves around 85 − 99% accuracy for SNR levels 0 dB 
and above. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively 
differentiate between obfuscated and non-obfuscated symbols, even when a transmitter 
switches between them as a new defense mechanism, achieving an accuracy of 95%.
